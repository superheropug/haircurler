# haircurler
Haircurler is an open-source application intended to be used for API testing. 
Don't worry, we don't have accounts. I don't even have servers! 
For those of you who are sick of needing to sign in to your API tool, but also uncomfortable with using cURL through CMD, Haircurler is for you!
Haircurler just runs cURL in the background, with a GUI. 
I also plan to save requests and add a number of other features as well!
How to install:
  - Download and build the application, you will need a JRE and JDK, 21 or newer.
  - Build it to an executable JAR
  - Install cURL
  - Run, you should see your cURL version in the top right.
